# bareos-formula

A saltstack formula to install and configure [BareOS](https://www.bareos.org>),
a master/slave server tool.

(This formula will probably be useful to install Bacula too, just changing the
`pkg` variables in the pillar data).

## OS Compatibility


Tested with:

* Debian 8
* CentOS 6 and 7
* Ubuntu 16.04

See the full [Salt Formulas installation and usage instructions](http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/development/conventions/formulas.html)

## Formula Dependencies

This formula won't try to install or configure a database server, just tries to
configure the BareOS database if possible. In case you want to use ``Postgresql``
or ``MySQL``, use the respective formulas. If your database is on another host,
you just need to configure the database host/user/password in the pillar.

## Available states

### **`bareos`**

Installs and configures all the bareos components (includes ``bareos.director``,
``bareos.storage`` and ``bareos.client``.

### **`bareos.director`**
Installs and configures the bareos director, and starts the associated service.

### **`bareos.director_dynamic_config`**
Dynamically add/remove clients and their director specific configuration based on mine functions.

### **`bareos.storage`**
Installs and configures the bareos storage, and starts the associated service.

### **`bareos.client`**
Meta-state that includes `bareos.filedaemon`, `baeros.bconsole`  and `bareos.traymonitor`.

### **`bareos.filedaemon`**
Installs and configures the bareos filedaemon, and starts the associated service.

### **`bareos.bconsole`**
Installs and configures the bareos console.

### **`bareos.repo`**
Configures the upstream bareos' repo (true, by default).

### **`bareos.traymonitor`**
Installs and configures the bareos tray-monitor.

## Example Pillar

BareOS daemons' configuration, since version >= 16.2.2, can be done by mean of
config files or config directories/subdirectories.

The formula, to ease management, follows this logic:

1. By default, the formula will setup and use the upstream BareOS repo.

2. If no pillar key named `config` exists for a given daemon, it will be intalled
   and the default configuration included in the package (or a custom configuration
   set by any other mean) will be used. No configuration will be attempted.

   This means the current `subdirectories` configuration schema provided by the
   package will be used (see [Configuration Layout](http://doc.bareos.org/master/html/bareos-manual-main-reference.html#QQ2-1-150).

3. If a pillar key named `config` is present for a given daemon, it will be
   installed and configured. This formula will use the "old approach" of setting
   all the configuration for the daemon in a single file, ignoring the rest of the
   included subdirectories. This may seem counter-intuitive at first, because
   reading different small configuration files is easier. But the advantage is
   that, when you remove a key/value from the bareos pillar, the config file
   will be regenerated and you won't need to remove lingering files, or keep
   pillar keys with 'remove/delete/disable' values.

   The configuration for each BareOS daemon (director, storage, filedaemon) is
   generated from pillar data if a key `config` exist for such daemon, ie:

```yaml
bareos:

  director:
    ...
    config:
      ...
      ...
```

   If no `config` section is given, no configuration will be perfomed, and the
   existing configuration will be used (or the one provided by the package).

   The `config` sections are ordered by resource type, like in the following example.

   Keys names are case insensitive.

   Keys that can be repeated multiple times (like `run`, in Schedules) should be
   written as lists, and they will be expanded accordingly.

   Resources that require a `Name` will use the provided one, or the dict name if no
   `Name` is provided.

   Resources that require `Password`, will use the provided password in each `config`
   section, or will use the password set in 'bareos:default_password'. If none is
   specified, this formula will use "default_bareos_formula_password" as the default
   password).

   The include file `@` parameter is an 'special case' of the resource_type, and should
   be written as a list instead of a dict, as shown below.

```yaml
bareos:
  daemon:
    config:
      resource_type1:
        resource1_name:
          param1: value1
          param2: 2
          param3:
            sub_param3a:
              param3b: value3b
              param3c: true
              param3d:
                - value3d_1
                - value3d_2
                - value3d_3
              param3e: value_3e
            sub_param3b: 3
        resource2_name:
          name: someothername
          param1: value1

      resource_type2:
        resource3_name:
          param2: value2

      '@':
        - 'include_file1'
        - '|"/etc/bareos/generate_configuration_to_stdout.sh"'
        - '|"sh -c \"/etc/bareos/generate_client_configuration_to_stdout.sh clientname=client1.example.com\""'
```

   will create the following config file:

``` yaml
resource_type1 {

    Name = "resource1_name"

    param1 = "value1"
    param2 = 2
    param3 {

        sub_param3a {

            param3b = "value3b"
            param3c = True
            param3d = "value3d_1"
            param3d = "value3d_2"
            param3d = "value3d_3"
            param3e = "value_3e"
        }
        sub_param3b = 3
    }
}

resource_type1 {

    Name = "someothername"

    param1 = "value1"

}

resource_type2 {

    Name = "resource3_name"

    param2 = "value2"

}

@include_file1
@|"/etc/bareos/generate_configuration_to_stdout.sh"
@|"sh -c \"/etc/bareos/generate_client_configuration_to_stdout.sh clientname=client1.example.com\""
```

   See *bind/pillar.example* for a full example.

Director Dynamic Configuration
==============================

The Salt Mine is used to collect arbitrary data from Minions and store it on the Master.
This data is then made available to all Minions via the salt.modules.mine module.
```
More info: https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/mine/
```
We leverage this functionality to automatically add/remove clients to director and associate
them with the relevant jobs, jobdef and schedules.

### How to use it
Add `bareos.director_dynamic_config` state your director TOP state file

On every minion pillar, you should add the supported mine functions and the relevant pillar config
as the example below:
``` yaml
  mine_functions:
  bareos_client:
    - mine_function: pillar.get
    - bareos:filedaemon:config:Director:bareos-dir:Password
  bareos_dynamic_cfg:
    - mine_function: pillar.get
    - bareos:dynamic

bareos:
  filedaemon:
    config:
      Director:
        bareos-dir:
          ...
          Password: 'PL5_Ch4ng3_M3!_client'
      Client:
        ...
      Messages:
        ...
  dynamic:
    Job:
      {{ grains['fqdn'] }}-sample-job:
        JobDefs: "{{ grains['fqdn'] }}-sample-jobdef"
        Client: "{{ grains['fqdn'] }}"
    JobDefs:
      {{ grains['fqdn'] }}-sample-jobdef:
        ...
```
